# Multi-Document Retrieval with Watsonx ðŸ˜»

**A Streamlit-powered app for querying multiple document types using Watsonx and LangChain.**

This project allows users to upload various file formats (PDFs, DOCX, CSV, JSON, YAML, HTML, etc.) and retrieve contextually accurate responses using Watsonx LLM models and LangChain. The app provides a seamless interface to perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from uploaded documents.

**Note**: While this app runs efficiently on machines with low specifications, for faster indexing and response times, I recommend using a more powerful machine.

## Features

- **File Support**: Supports multiple file formats such as PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, CSV, JSON, YAML, HTML, and plain text.
- **Watsonx LLM Integration**: Utilize IBM Watsonx's LLM models for querying and generating answers.
- **Embeddings**: Uses `HuggingFace` embeddings for document indexing.
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Combines document-based retrieval with LLMs for accurate responses.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides an intuitive user experience.

### Install Dependencies

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. Install required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following keys:

```env
WATSONX_API_KEY=<your_watsonx_api_key>
WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=<your_watsonx_project_id>
```

### Run the App

1. Start the Streamlit app by running:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open the URL displayed in your terminal (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)) to access the app.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Documents**: Drag and drop supported files (e.g., PDFs, DOCX, JSON) in the app sidebar.
2. **Select Model and Parameters**: Choose a Watsonx model and configure settings like output tokens and decoding methods.
3. **Ask Questions**: Enter queries in the chat input to retrieve answers based on the uploaded document.
